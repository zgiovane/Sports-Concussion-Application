# Sports-Concussion-Application

This repository contains the development of the Sport Concussion Assessment System, a software application aimed at helping sport medical practitioners monitor athletes' conditions for symptoms of concussion. The purpose is to develop an application that facilitates the timely diagnosis of concussions in athletes, helping to mitigate potential risks to their well-being. By providing a digital platform for athletes to input their health conditions and symptoms after each game/training session, the system aims to assist sport medical practitioners in identifying any significant changes in symptoms and advising athletes accordingly.
