# Sports Concussion Assessment System

## Summary

This repository contains the development of the Sport Concussion Assessment System, a software application aimed at helping sport medical practitioners monitor athletes' conditions for symptoms of concussion. The purpose is to develop an application that facilitates the timely diagnosis of concussions in athletes, helping to mitigate potential risks to their well-being. By providing a digital platform for athletes to input their health conditions and symptoms after each game/training session, the system aims to assist sport medical practitioners in identifying any significant changes in symptoms and advising athletes accordingly.

### Introduction

As of today, one of the most commonly used tools for assessing concussions in sports is a paper-based diagnostic tool. When there are thousands of athletes and an equally high number of sport medical practitioners involved, this paper-based tool can be cumbersome and quite slow. Using a computerized tool for both the athletes and medical practitioners can help speed up and simplify this process.

### Objectives

- Design and build a console-based application for athletes and medical practitioners.
- Describe the functionality and supported workflows using UML diagrams such as Use Case diagram and Class diagrams.
